# Contributing to Kubernetes
## A quick guide to get started
#### Jonas Rosland, VMware
#### Guinevere Saenger, GitHub

On your own you focus on functionality and code.
Folks say code is king, but not always true. Often, it's
open source interactions

Many places you can contribute:
* docs
* tests
* integrations
* releases
* security are all opportunities for contributing.

Guinevere shows how to submit a pull request to Kubernetes
project.

* Look for "good first issue" & "help wanted" issues.
* file an issue and work on it
* sometimes you can skip straight to a PR
* Fix golint failures #68026
