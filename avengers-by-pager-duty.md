# Avengers Assemble: The Thanos Incident
#### Matty Stratton, PagerDuty

The speaker used the Avengers movies to illustrate a service incident and how to
do a post mortem about how Thanos got the infinity stones. It was quite
entertaining point of few.

Some key things I remember were focus on the facts, the what and the how. Not as
much as the who and the why. Try to be blameless unlike the Avengers who seem to
blame each other for everything.
